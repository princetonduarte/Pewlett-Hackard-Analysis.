# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to determine how many employees would be retiring and what titles they held. Another part of the project was to determine who was elgible to take part of the mentorship program. Using the born between dates of January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, I used a query that woud retirve the employee number, first name, last name, title, from dates and to dates.

## Summary

In summary, the company will need to find a way to fill about 70 percent of the vacant positions that will be left by the retiring workforce in the next few years. Acting on this will alleviate the impact of the “silver tsunami” situation. If the company can find ways to attract and train the younger generations of workers then the effect would be considerably less to manage. Right now there appears to be enough talent and knowledge to mentor the incoming and internal younger workers.
